mongoDB - Norm - MVC 2 Example with Visual Studio 2010
======================================================

### This app was created as a learning process for mongoDB and NoRM. There are also imcomplete references and examples using the mongodb-csharp driver. I created a very simple blog to learn how to work with documents, as well as their nested documents in mongoDB.

### Other technologies used:

- ASP .NET MVC 2
- MVC validation with ComponentModel.DataAnnotations
- Dependency Injection with Castle
- Captcha validation with reCaptcha


TODO
====
- Still learning TDD, needs to add some tests for the different repositories.
- Fix routing to Home/PostView/aaaaaa (not Home/PostView?Id=aaaaaa)
