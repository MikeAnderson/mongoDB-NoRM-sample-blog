<p>This app was created as a learning process for mongoDB and NoRM. There are also imcomplete references and examples using the mongodb-csharp driver. I created a very simple blog to learn how to work with documents, as well as their nested documents in mongoDB.</p>

<p>Other technologies used in this example

<ul>
	<li>ASP .NET MVC 2</li>
	<li>MVC validation with ComponentModel.DataAnnotations</li>
	<li>Dependency Injection with Castle</li>
	<li>Captcha validation with reCaptcha</li>
